A taglet that generates UML diagrams with
[PlantUML](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/) for inclusion in the javadoc.

<a href="https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.jdrupes.taglets%22%20AND%20a%3A%22plantuml-taglet%22"><img src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.jdrupes.taglets/plantuml-taglet.svg"></a>

**Please note that starting with version 2.0.0 the taglet works with
the API introduced in Java 9. It has been tested with Java-11.**

**Starting with version 3.0.0 the taglet requires Java-17.**

Simply use the `@plantUml` tag to generate the graphics file from the
PlantUML source[^1]:

```java
/**
 * Description.
 *
 * <img src="example.svg">
 *
 * This package/class ...
 *
 * @plantUml example.svg
 * Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
 * Alice <-- Bob: Authentication Response
 */
```

This is rendered as:

---

Description.

![Example Diagram](org/jdrupes/taglets/plantUml/example.svg)

This package/class ...

---

[^1]: The PlantUML source for the example above is actually
    in the package description instead of the overview source file.
    Java-11 to Java-15 (at least) drop block tags from an overview file.
    (Used to worked in Java-8.) See the report in the
    [Java Bug Database](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8264274)

The usage of "`<`" and "`>`" in PlantUML make javadoc complain about
illegal HTML tokens. Of course, you could use "`&amp;lt;`" and "`&amp;gt;`" but
this reduces the readability of the UML descriptions and is therefore
not supported (the taglet does *not* scan for these sequences and convert
them). You could globally disable HTML checks with e.g. "`-Xdoclint:-html`"
when using PlantUML but this might prevent other problems from being detected.

The preferred approach is to put the PlantUML source in comments as
shown below.

```java
/**
 * @plantUml package.svg
 * &lt;!--
 * Bob <-- Alice: Authentication Request
 * Alice <-- Bob: Authentication Response
 * --&gt;
 */
```

The taglet removes the comment delimiters and uses the resulting content
as PlantUML source. Of course, you also have to avoid all "`-->`" arrows in
your PlantUML description as this would terminate the HTML comment
prematurely. Luckily, this isn't too hard because you can always exchange
the left and right side of such a relation.

It's also possible to use `@startuml` and `@enduml` instead of `@plantuml`,
which is the common usage pattern. `@startuml` is simply a synonym for
`@plantUml` and `@enduml` will be ignored entirely. Use this for
compatibility with other tools, like e.g. the
[PlantUML Eclipse Plugin](http://plantuml.com/eclipse) or the
[PlantUML IDEA Plugin](https://github.com/esteinberg/plantuml4idea).

## Invoking

### Gradle

Configuring a taglet in the javadoc task is not explicitly shown in the
[DSL Reference](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html).
The required properties can be found in the
[standard options](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/external/javadoc/StandardJavadocDocletOptions.html)

Here's an example:

```groovy
configurations {
    taglets
}

dependencies {
    taglets "org.jdrupes.taglets:plantuml-taglet:2.1.0"
}

javadoc {
    options.tagletPath = configurations.taglets.files.asType(List)
    options.taglets = ["org.jdrupes.taglets.plantUml.PlantUml", "org.jdrupes.taglets.plantUml.StartUml", "org.jdrupes.taglets.plantUml.EndUml"
}
```

The latest version available on maven central is shown in the badge at the
beginning of this page.

### Command line

Specify the taglet on JavaDoc's command line:

```terminal
javadoc -taglet org.jdrupes.taglets.plantUml.Taglet -tagletpath /path/to/plantuml-taglet.jar:/path/to/plantuml.jar
```

This could be simplified by providing a "fat jar", but I doubt that anybody would
really use it.

### Maven

Still using this? Well, you're on your own...
